Topic Idea: 
A web application to process and compile statistics of Slippi (.slp) files, allowing users to submit their match details to see trends and metrics of their games. 
Slippi is a community project for Super Smash Brothers Melee, which implements replays and statistics to the game, as well as provide a method to play this game online through emulation. 
Currently, .slp files can only be viewed individually. The purpose of this project is to allow players to 1. Analyze statistics for a bulk amount of time/ games and 2. Allow users to save their statistics, without having to have .slp files saved on their computer
